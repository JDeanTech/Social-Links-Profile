### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
figured out how to use a link to open in new tab <li><a href="https://github.com/JDeanTech" target="_blank">GitHub</a></li>
```
```css
.social-links li a:hover,
.social-links li a:focus{
    color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%); /*this adds the white color to the text when hover is activated*/
    background-color: royalblue; /*this adds the blue color to the highlighted link hover*/
    transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out; /*this is to add a transition to the hover effect*/
    
}
```
