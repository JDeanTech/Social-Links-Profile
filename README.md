### Links
- github url: [https://github.com/JDeanTech/Social-Links-Profile.git]


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned a lot about hover feature in CSS and working to learn more about margin and padding it can be a little confusing.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
figured out how to use a link to open in new tab :

<li><a href="https://github.com/JDeanTech" target="_blank">GitHub</a></li>
```
```css
was able to setup a few links with hover/focus features:

.social-links li a:hover,
.social-links li a:focus{
    color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%); /*this adds the white color to the text when hover is activated*/
    background-color: royalblue; /*this adds the blue color to the highlighted link hover*/
    transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out; /*this is to add a transition to the hover effect*/
    
}
```

### Continued development

In future developement im going to work on improving my ability to use padding/margin correctly
